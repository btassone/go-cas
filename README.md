# CAS Client library

This is a fork of https://github.com/go-cas/cas and continuation of their work with updates and hopefully some useful
QOL features.

CAS provides a http package compatible client implementation for use with securing http frontends in golang.

go get github.com/btassone/go-cas@v2.2.1
